Techniques for providing atomicity and durability (two of the ACID properties) in database systems.
In a system using WAL, all modifications are written to a log before they are applied. Usually both redo 
and undo information is stored in the log.

The purpose of this can be illustrated by an example. 
Imagine a program that is in the middle of performing some operation when the machine 
it is running on loses power. Upon restart, that program might well need to know whether 
the operation it was performing succeeded, half-succeeded, or failed. If a write-ahead log 
is used, the program can check this log and compare what it was supposed to be doing when it 
unexpectedly lost power to what was actually done. On the basis of this comparison, the 
program could decide to undo what it had started, complete what it had started, or keep things as they are.
