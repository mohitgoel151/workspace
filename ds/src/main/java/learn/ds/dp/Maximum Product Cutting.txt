Given a rope of length n meters, cut the rope in different parts of integer lengths in a way that maximizes 
product of lengths of all parts. You must make at least one cut. Assume that the length of rope is more than 2 meters. 


// A Dynamic Programming solution for Max Product Problem
int maxProd(int n)
{
   int val[n+1];
   val[0] = val[1] = 0;
  
   // Build the table val[] in bottom up manner and return
   // the last entry from the table
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
   {
      for (int j = 1; j <= i/2; j++)
         val[i] = max(val[i], (i-j)*j, j*val[i-j]);

   }
   return val[n];
}



Time Complexity of the Dynamic Programming solution is O(n^2) and it requires O(n) extra space
