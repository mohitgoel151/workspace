 * There is an infinite integer grid at which N people have their houses on. 
 * They decide to unite at a common meeting place, which is someone's house. 
 * From any given cell, all 8 adjacent cells are reachable in 1 unit of time. 
 * eg: (x,y) can be reached from (x-1,y+1) in a single unit of time.
 * Find a common meeting place which minimizes the sum of the travel times of all the persons.
