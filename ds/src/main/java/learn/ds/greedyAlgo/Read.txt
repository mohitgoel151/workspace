Following are some standard algorithms that are Greedy algorithms.

1) Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): In Kruskal’s algorithm, 
we create a MST by picking edges one by one. The Greedy Choice is 
to pick the smallest weight edge that doesn’t cause a cycle in the 
MST constructed so far.


2) Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree: In Prim’s algorithm also, 
we create a MST by picking edges one by one. We maintain two sets: 
set of the vertices already included in MST and the set of the vertices 
not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that connects the two sets.


3) Dijkstra’s Shortest Path: The Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to 
Prim’s algorithm. The shortest path tree is built up, edge by edge. We maintain 
two sets: set of the vertices already included in the tree and the set of the 
vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the edge that connects 
the two sets and is on the smallest weight path from source to the set that contains not yet included vertices.


4) Huffman Coding: Huffman Coding is a loss-less compression technique. 
It assigns variable length bit codes to different characters. The Greedy Choice 
is to assign least bit length code to the most frequent character.
